# Monitoring OpenCGA

OpenCGA currently supports tracing agents. To begin monitoring OpenCGA, the corresponding tracing jar file should be present within this monitor folder.

## Datadog

To use Datadog agent, users would need to download the latest datadog tracer jar file as so:

```shell script
wget -O dd-java-agent.jar https://dtdg.co/latest-java-tracer
```
