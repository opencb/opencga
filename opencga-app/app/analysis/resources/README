README

This directory is designated for OpenCGA analyses to download the necessary external data.
For instance, during the first Exomiser analysis, the files '2109_hg38.zip' and '2109_phenotype.zip' will be downloaded
from the OpenCGA analysis URL and stored in the 'exomiser' folder within this directory. Subsequent Exomiser analyses will
then access this folder to read these files.
